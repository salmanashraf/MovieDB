MVVM

# MVVM with Clean Architecture is good for separating the responsibilities of code. It separates view like activity & fragment from business logic. 

#Models: hold application data. Theyâ€™re usually structs or simple classes.
#Views: display visual elements and controls on the screen. It's like Activity & Fragments
#View models: transform model information into values that can be displayed on a view.
